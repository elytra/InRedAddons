EncoderTweaks adds hooks to vanilla blocks to work specifically with InfraRedstone encoders. Currently implemented:

- Lecterns will give a signal of `0b00_0000 (0)` to `0b11_1111 (63)` based on book progress.
- Cauldrons will give a signal of `0b00_0000 (0)`, `0b00_0001 (1)`, `0b00_0010 (2)`, or `0b00_0100 (4)` based on their fill percentage
