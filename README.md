InRedAddons adds a few more features for InfraRedstone. Currently implemented:

- LED and LED blocks to provide light responsive to InRed signals
- Mixins to add encoder functionality to vanilla blocks:
    - Lecterns will give a signal of `0b00_0000 (0)` to `0b11_1111 (63)` based on book progress.
    - Cauldrons will give a signal of `0b00_0000 (0)`, `0b00_0001 (1)`, `0b00_0010 (2)`, or `0b00_0100 (4)` based on their fill percentage
